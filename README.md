Python Snake Game

This is a Python implementation of the Snake Game with the pygame as a separate board so the presentation layer can be replaced easily with other technology. And the user input is handled as an one-hot-encoding of [ forward, right, left ], which can be integrated to the Machine Learning.

So, this can be adopted easily for the Machine Learnig such as the Genetic Algorithm or the Reinforcement Learning.
